# Card ordering algorithm 2.1.13

## Request
- In order by suit and by rank within each suit;
- Card must be laid out face down in a row
- Only allow check the values of two cards and to exchange two cards

Solution idea:
- Use **Selection sort** first to make suits gather together
    - Step0: n = 0;
    - Step1: Check the suit of the card[i] and card[j]
        - If the same, i = i+1, n++;
            - If n == 4: i = i+1; go to Step0;
        - If different and n<3, exchange card[j] with the last card, go to Step1
- Inside each suit, use **Selection sort** or **Insert sort** alg to order
